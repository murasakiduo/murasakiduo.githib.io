Since its founding in 1996, the Murasaki Duo has been dedicated to performing the cello and piano literature as chamber music. It has concertized throughout the United States, Canada, and Scandinavia, including concerts in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto, Copenhagen, and Oslo, and it has won recognition as one of the leading ensembles of its genre. The Duo is ensemble-in-residence at [Luther College](http://music.luther.edu/ "Luther College Music Department") in Decorah, Iowa.
