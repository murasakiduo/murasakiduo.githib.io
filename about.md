Since its founding in 1996, the Murasaki Duo has been dedicated to performing the cello and piano literature as chamber music. The Duo's recent Carnegie Hall concert was lauded by _New York Concert Review_ as possessing "an unusually high level of ensemble playing," and having "an easy virtuosity." The Murasaki Duo has performed throughout the United States and Canada, including concerts in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Toronto, and has won recognition as one of the leading ensembles of its genre. Advocates for new music, it actively commissions new works, in addition to performing the classics.

The Duo released its debut compact disc---featuring works of Beethoven, Chopin, and Rachmaninoff---on the Centaur Records label. It has been a part of leading festivals, such as the Niagara International Chamber Music Festival, the Icicle Creek Music Center, the Malibu Coast Music Festival, and Lutheran Summer Music, and it has been broadcast repeatedly on Iowa Public Radio's program _Know the Score_. It regularly performs on chamber music series throughout the nation.

The Duo toured Scandinavia in 2005. This season the Duo will appear on the campuses of Luther College, Macalester College, Vanderbilt University, Middle Tennessee State University, Dickinson College, and Western Connecticut University; it will also appear on concert series in Malibu, California; Minneapolis, Rochester, and Saint Paul, Minnesota; and Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, Spillville, and Fairfield, Iowa. The Murasaki Duo is Ensemble-in-Residence at [Luther College](http://music.luther.edu), Decorah, Iowa.
